## Domain and business concepts

When dealing with business projects, we can "depare" with specific jargons. From this, we have the ubiquitous language

> Ubiquitous language for this case

- SKU (stock-keeping-unit): identification of a product (in practice, the product name)

- Customers: place *orders*

- Order: identified by an *order reference*; comprises multiple *order lines* {src\model.py}

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order line: has a SKU and a *quantity*

- Batch: related to stock. Has a unique ID, a SKU and a quantity

**Here, we start projecting how the entities will work, paying attention in some business rules**

- Order lines must be allocated to batches
- We must deal with *available quantity*: addition and deletion of elements according to orders
- It's not possible to allocate a order whose quantity is higher than the available in batch (business test-case)
- We can't allocate the same line twice (test-case)
- We will face scenarios like - batches have an *ETA* if they are currently shipping, or they may be in *warehouse*

>(at firsy glance, looks kinda crazy and contraintuituve the ideia of developing the test before the underlying code, but when applied, we have to admit: it's a very clever approach)ðŸ¤ª
